asbestos
========

Asbestos has the dubious honor of being the worst Campfire client I've ever used! You should use it too!

Use
---

There is a (pre-)release! You can use it! By using this campfire client you relieve me of all liability for pain, suffering, and emotional anguish caused by the use of this client, especially while configuring and finding that you cannot choose which room you join yet!

Or especially when you try to run it without the [asbestos.properties](https://github.com/willluongo/asbestos/blob/master/asbestos.properties) file in the same directory as the jar!

Or if you forget to populate said [asbestos.properties](https://github.com/willluongo/asbestos/blob/master/asbestos.properties) file with your own subdomain and API authentication token from campfire's "My Info" page in your browser!

Dependencies
------------
Sure you can build it yourself, if you need the bleeding edge version of the worst Campfire client available! You just need to manually assemble the dependencies first!

* Java 7
* A [campfire](https://campfirenow.com) account of your very own
* [Jinder](https://github.com/flintinatux/jinder) which requires the [google-http-java-client library](https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/)
* SWT for your platform
* log4j2 even though I don't configure a useful logger... yet!
